This branch contains several samples that were tested on **Windows 10 10074 + Visual Studio 2015 RC**

Before using of samples you need to set environment variable ```OCV2015_ROOT``` to the OpenCV location (e.g. ```Path\to\OCV\opencv```)

The following samples succesfully build with VS2015 RC:

[highgui_xaml](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/opencv/tree/vs2015-samples/samples/winrt_universal/highgui_xaml) (*Release, Win32*)

[VideoioXAML-arm](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/opencv/tree/vs2015-samples/samples/winrt_universal/VideoioXAML-arm) (*Release, ARM*)

Building of configurations other than mentioned in brackets is not guaranteed and may require additional updates of headers/libraries paths.
